    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>IÂ´m a maexican adult who is 34 years old and who has finished 2 careers</p>
    <p>I'm used to work under pressure due to my time in the gatronomy area working as a cook, waiter, barista and host. But also due to my short time in event managment where everything had to be on time with the correct form and all the specs the clients had asked.</p>
    <p>Through all of this I learned about lidership and how people tend to follow reliable people. When I stared to see that my co workers stared to ask about work related stuff to me rather than our bosses or some seniors, I developed a sense of teching and guide to my co workers and with this my leadership skill started to develope.</p>
